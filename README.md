# MRCheckBoxButton
Check box button, add border, fill color along with tick drawing animation. Use storyboard to set properties or code whatver. 

You will need to add the ***MRCheckBoxButton.swift*** to your project and subclass the `UIButton` to this class.
To set properties using the storyboard, just open up the attributes inspector.

Also you will have to do just one more thing in the attributes inspector.
Just like in the screenshot below, make sure you set the `State Config` to `Selected` and then set the `UIButton` type to `Custom`. If you don't do this then when you tap the button, you'll get a blue background.

And in your code all you have to do is change the selected state of the subclassed `UIButton` to show or hide the tick. Sorta like this:

    @IBAction func buttonAction(_ sender: MRCheckBoxButton) {
        
         sender.updateSelection(select: !sender.currentlySelected)
    }

You can pass another parameter into the `updateSelection` api to stop the animation and instantly update it.
